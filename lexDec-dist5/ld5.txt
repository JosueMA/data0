Distance-from-5 experiment in Rouder et al. 2005, Psych Bull Rev.

I cannot find the original data files for this experiment.  This file
has been floating around in my teaching files as an example of
cleaning.  It is the data we used, for sure, but I am not thrilled
that there is no audit trail.  It might be in the filesystem, but I
cant find it.

Columns:
1. Subject number 0...,58, missing some
2. Block number. 0,..,5
3. Trial Number 0,..,59
4. Stimulus: 0 to 5,
    0=2  
    1=3
    2=4
    3=6
    4=7
    5=8
5. Resp 0,1 (what is 8? must be inadmissable response)
    0= <5
    1= >5
6. RT in milliseconds
7. Error/Accuracy 0=correct, 1=error
