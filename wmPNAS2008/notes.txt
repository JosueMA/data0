Jeff Rouder, 11/15

I am trying to reconscruct what was done in the PNAS 2008 working
memory paper.  It is not well documented.  To the best of my
knowledge, here are the data files:

The directory LUCK2 has all the raw data files
lk2cat is the concatination,
lk2clean is smaller than lk2dat and may have RTs less than 5s removed
That was a common cleaning step for these data.

My understanding is that we used lk12dat with the RT<5 filter
throughout.

Let me know.

Best,
Jeff
