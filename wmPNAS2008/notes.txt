The directory LUCK2 has all the raw data files
lk2cat is the concatination and contains all trials (12420)
lk2dat.csv contains all trials (12420)

lk2clean.csv has the following discards:
a. all trials with RT>5 sec 
b. all trials with responses other than the two indicated keys for "change" and "same" (e.g., they hit a space key by mistake).

Here is some R code to compare the files:


intext=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data0/master/wmPNAS2008/lk2data.csv")
data=read.csv(text=intext)
dim(data)

intext=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data0/master/wmPNAS2008/lk2clean.csv")
clean=read.csv(text=intext)
dim(clean)


data=data[data$resp!=-1,]
data=data[data$RT<5,]
dim(data)




Any troubles?  Let me know.

Best,
Jeff
