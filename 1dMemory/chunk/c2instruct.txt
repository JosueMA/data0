1. Task: There are 7 lines.  Each line has a number.  1 is for the 
shortest, 7 is for the longest.  On each trial, we present one line.  You 
job is to respond with the corresponding number.  

2. After each response,  there will be feedback.  There will be a pleasent 
"da-da" sound if you get it right.  If you get it wrong, we will tell you 
the right answer.  

3. Use the row of numbers on the keyboard and not the number pad.  Please 
follow the keyboard order with 1 for 1, 2 for 2, ..., 7 for 7. 

4. We know the task can be frustrating at times.  The best way for us to 
learn about how vision and memory works is to put you in difficult 
situations.  We expect you to make mistakes.  Please do not take any 
extradinary measures like trying to measure the lines with a ruler, a 
piece of paper, your fingers, etc.  Just make the best guess you can using 
your eye-sight based judgments.

5.  There are 22 short blocks of 35.  Each block takes a minute or two to 
complete.  Most people are done within 40 minutes.  Please feel free to 
take a break in-between blocks.

FOR C2_CNN and C2_CNW:  
6. The computer will show the length of the lines and the corresponding 
numbers before each block.

FOR C2_CHN and C1_CHW:
6. The number assignment for each line is constant throughout the 
experiment.  Some of the blocks will have all 7 line lengths.  Others 
will have fewer than 7.   Before each block, you will be given 
the line lengths that will be shown and their corresponding number.

7.  When you are done, come see me here in 205.  We greatly appreciate 
your time and effort.  At the end, I will tell you what our goals are in 
this experiment.
